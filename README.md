# Gift-Card-Application
The modified program includes all of the following:
	Both classes display currency data with a $ sign and two decimal places
	Gift card number is displayed to the user
	Remaining card balance is displayed after a withdrawal 
	If the amount to be deducted is greater than the available balance, the transaction will be cancelled and the message “insufficient funds on card” will be displayed to the user
	Added an expiration date
	Added card type ' S ' for store and ' R ' for regular gift card (did not change data type to String - it seemed easier to do. I used char instead).
	Extra: Created a summary for all the data that was entered and calculations that were made. Results are displayed on a pop-up box.
	Extra: Used all setter and getter methods and added more as needed from GiftCards class
